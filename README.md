# Annotorious Semantic Tagging Plugin

A plugin to [Annotorious](http://annotorious.github.io) which adds __Semantic Tagging__
functionality: while typing the annotation, text is sent to the server for
[Named Entity Recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition).
Recognized entities are suggested as possible tags, and the user can add them to the
annotation by clicking on them (see screenshot). Tags are _Semantic Tags_ in the sense that
they are not only strings, but (underneath the hood) include a link to their corresponding
[DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org) entry.
